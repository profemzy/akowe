## Migration Notes

When switching from SQLite to PostgreSQL, note the following differences:

1. PostgreSQL is case-sensitive for identifiers unless quoted
2. PostgreSQL has more strict type checking
3. Some SQLite-specific functions may not work in PostgreSQL

Always test migrations in a development environment before applying them to production.
