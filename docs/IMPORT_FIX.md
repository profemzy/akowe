# Import Issue Fix for Akowe

## Problem
When running tests, we encountered an import error: `cannot import name 'create_app' from 'akowe'`. This indicated a module structure issue where the `create_app` function could not be found by the test files.

## Solution
We implemented the following solution:

1. **Proper Package Structure**
   - Created/updated `pyproject.toml` with build system information
   - Created a proper `setup.py` file with dependencies
   - Installed the package in development mode with `pip install -e .`

2. **Import Organization**
   - Moved the application factory function to `akowe/akowe.py`
   - Updated imports in app.py and tests to use the correct path 
   - Fixed circular imports by reorganizing module structure

3. **Test Configuration**
   - Created working test examples (`test_ping.py` and `simple_test.py`)
   - Updated conftest.py to properly import the application factory
   - Used direct imports where needed to avoid circular references

## Testing
After implementing these changes, we verified that:
- The application runs properly
- Basic tests run successfully 
- The test collection works for all test functions

## Remaining Challenges
Some tests still fail due to missing resources (templates, etc.), but this is a configuration issue rather than an import problem. These can be fixed by:
- Setting up proper test fixtures
- Mocking the necessary resources
- Providing test versions of templates and other application assets

## Next Steps
1. Fix template loading in tests (can use mock templates or in-memory templates)
2. Ensure the database setup works properly in tests
3. Provide any mock objects needed for authentication and other services
